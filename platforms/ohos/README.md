# accesskit_ohos

AccessKit adapter for the ArkUI native accessibility provider API on
OpenHarmony/HarmonyOS NEXT.

The adapter is attached to an accessibility `Provider` obtained from an
XComponent or an `ARKUI_NODE_CUSTOM`. It retains the AccessKit tree, answers
ArkUI's synchronous node queries, forwards native actions to AccessKit, and
reports tree/focus changes back to ArkUI.

```rust,ignore
let provider = xcomponent.accessibility_provider()?;
let adapter = accesskit_ohos::Adapter::new(
    provider,
    activation_handler,
    action_handler,
)?;

adapter.update_if_active(|| next_tree_update());
```

`Adapter::new` uses the standard callback registration recommended for a
single ArkUI custom node or XComponent. Frameworks that intentionally use
ArkUI's API 15 multi-instance callback contract can use
`Adapter::new_with_instance` instead when the `api-15` feature is enabled.

The OpenHarmony native API does not expose an unregister function. Dropping
the adapter disables its Rust callback target, so any late native callback
returns a failure without touching released application state.

## API levels

The adapter defaults to the `api-13` feature, which is sufficient for an
XComponent accessibility provider and for all core tree, action, and event
operations. Higher API features form an additive ladder:

- API 15 adds multi-instance callback registration and next/previous HTML item
  action handling.
- An ArkUI `ARKUI_NODE_CUSTOM` host needs API 23 to obtain its accessibility
  provider. This requirement belongs to the ArkUI host integration; the
  adapter still only consumes the resulting `Provider`.
- Enable `api-24` when AccessKit `author_id` values must be exposed through
  ArkUI's `componentIdentifier` property.

Applications should select the highest API feature supported by their minimum
deployment target. Enabling `api-24` is not required for the core adapter.
